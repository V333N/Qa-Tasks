# Application Health Checker

## Overview
This Python script checks the uptime of an application by determining its HTTP status code. It assesses whether the application is 'up' (functioning correctly) or 'down' (unavailable or not responding).

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- `requests` library

## Setup

### Step 1: Install Python
Ensure that Python is installed on your system. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

### Step 2: Install `requests`
Install the `requests` library using `pip`. Open a terminal and run:
```bash
pip install requests
Step 3: Download the Script
Download the health_checker.py script and save it to your desired directory.


Configuration
Modify the url variable in the script to the URL of the application you want to check:

url = "http://example.com"  # Replace with the actual URL

Execution
Step 1: Navigate to the Script Directory
Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where you saved the health_checker.py script. For example:

cd /path/to/your/script

Step 2: Run the Script
Execute the script by running:

python health_checker.py

Expected Output
The script will check the application's status and print the result to the console.

Example Outputs
Application is UP:

The application at http://example.com is UP.
Application is DOWN (Status Code 404):

The application at http://example.com is DOWN. Status code: 404
Application is DOWN (Connection Error):

The application at http://example.com is DOWN. Error: HTTPConnectionPool(host='example.com', port=80): Max retries exceeded with url: / (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPConnection object at 0x7f8b24c6c790>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 111] Connection refused'))


Customization
You can customize the script to add more functionality or modify the alerting mechanism. The script is designed to be straightforward and easy to extend.
